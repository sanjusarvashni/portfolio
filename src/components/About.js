            <p>Hi, I’m Sanju Sarvashni, a passionate frontend developer with a focus on creating engaging and intuitive user experiences. I recently graduated in Computer Science and am excited to start my professional journey in web development.

I specialize in building dynamic and responsive web applications using React. My skills also include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a keen interest in modern development practices and tools.

I believe in crafting user-centric designs that not only look great but also function seamlessly across all devices. My goal is to combine aesthetics with performance to deliver exceptional user experiences.

I’m currently looking for opportunities to grow as a frontend developer, where I can contribute to impactful projects and continue to learn and evolve in a collaborative environment.

Feel free to browse my portfolio to see some of the projects I’ve worked on. If you’d like to get in touch or learn more about my work, don’t hesitate to contact me!</p>
